==========================================

Using the Dialog Viewer
-----------------------

Before running the dialog viewer, please make sure that you have 
.NET Framework 2.0 installed. If you do not have it installed, you
can download and install it through Windows Update.

The installation location for Jade Empire is taken from the registry.
If the viewer can't find your installation of Jade Empire, please
create the following registry key:
 
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BioWare\Jade Empire

...and create the string value "Path" pointing to your installation 
path.

To run the viewer, simply double-click on JadeDlg.exe. The left pane
will show the list of all resource files (areas) containing dialogs,
and the dialogs for each area. When you select a dialog in the left 
pane, the right pane will show you the possible conversation paths of
the dialog. Take care - for some dialogs the tree can be expanded
indefinitely!


Distribution
------------

The viewer is distributed under the GNU General Public License. You can
find the complete license text in the COPYING file in the installation 
archive.

The homepage of the project is:

  http://code.google.com/p/jadedlg/

On that page, you can download the latest version of the viewer, and also
download the source code for it. The source code is hosted in a Subversion
repository at:

  http://jadedlg.googlecode.com/svn/

The initial version of the tool has been released on April 13, 2007.

If you are willing to improve the dialog viewer (add more viewable resource
types, add support for other BioWare games, add editing support etc.), feel
free to contact me, and I will add you to the list of developers for the 
project. I do not have any major plans to develop the tool further myself.
